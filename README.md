# fibonacci_series
A C program to calculate fibonacci numbers

This program will tell print out a table of Fibonacci numbers. It also calculates and prints the time to do the calculation recursivly vs. how long it takes to calculate iteratively.
I've had difficulty running it correctly in Codeblocks.
In codeblocks the numbers don't print correctly past n=47. If you run the program in something else, for example, cygwin console,
then you get more numbers. The program can only run up to n=92 for signed 64-bit integers.
